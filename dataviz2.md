This is general data with Russia, US and OECD countries neighboring Ukraine highlighted. I was curious to learn which countries in the OECD were adjacent to Russia, and what their current GDP to Debt ratios were. I was also interested in the relative GDP to debt ratios of Russia and the US.

## A Visualization of GDP to Debt Ratio Trends for OECD Countries

This was an exercise in creating the spark lines. I opted for a brighter color.

## Looking for Debt to GDP Ratio Patterns for Sending Military Aid to Ukraine
In this data visualization, I wanted to see if there was a relationship between whether or not a country sent military aid to Ukraine and their debt. For this reason, I wanted to pull out the countries who did not send military aid with blue and color the military aid countries with red. If there was a recognizable pattern based on Debt to GDP ratios of these countries, then perhaps we could begin drawing some conclusions. No such recognizable patterns emerged. For designing this on flourish, I was hoping to include a legend or key that included this information, but I was unable to pull this function off.
