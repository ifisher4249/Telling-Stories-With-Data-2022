### Part 1 Ideation

Our journey began at the crossroads of necessity and opportunity. As a member of the development team for the CMU International Film Festival, I share responsiblity for organizing the fundraising campaign for this year's festival in March 2023. Our team is in our second year Post-Covid. During Covid, we lost a large body of organizational knowledge with the consecutive graduation of the entire 2019 staff. 2022 was a year for relearning and also identifying opportunities for our festival to strengthen its operations. One of our biggest weaknesses for the team, especially when going to funders, was our inability to tell compelling data stories. This year the team resolved to begin tracking data. A necessity was born. 

Opportunity knocked when I enrolled taking Telling Stories with Data. The team needed to develop a fundraising strategy, and all we had was a bunch of unassamilated data. A story needed to be told. 

At first I took this a bit too literally. My early idea was to turn this into a fictional comic book about a construction company that uses data visualizations as architecture. I couldn't stop thinking about heat maps looking like little brick roads and little bean-shaped "counters" jumping up and down bar chart sky scrapers. I presented some frenetic sketches with some graphs.  My classmates thought the concept was interesting, but recommended I focus a bit and consider something more focused and with a persuasive argument.

The truth was I hadn't actually looked at all of the dataset at that point. Much of it needed to be reformatted so that it could actually be analyzed. Over Thanksgiving break, I reentered a several hundred data entries from our various spreadsheets. This bit of skullduggery did afford me the opportunity to actually begin to understand what I was actually researching. By the end of it, I tried to create a few data questions that could guide a journey. Ultimately, we landed on what was most relevant for the festival. Our upcoming Fundraising Strategy. I was ready for Part 2. 

### Part 2 Wireframes and User Research

During this phase, I was mostly in a panic. There were about 48 hours between the due date for the wireframes and the close of Thanksgiving Break, and I had just finished up editing the workable data set. I felt behind the 8-ball, and certainly doubted that I would be able to turn in anything recognizable by the deadline. I contemplated taking an incomplete. 

CMU has taught me to leverage motivations against each other. Perhaps doubly motivated by the value developing the project would have outside the classroom as it did inside the classroom, I was able to plug my ears with music and whip together a mock-up of everything that was more/less in my head. To that end, I leaned heavily on the lessons we were learning in class. I saw myself violating them at almost every turn, but just figured if I could get something legible up there, it could be sorted out later. By the time the frenzy was done, a story began to emerge as did a strategy. It was like ripping a page straight from our Fundraising Textbook, but this time with _data_!

After seeking user research from donors, teammates from the festival, and former staff from other film festivals, and from my classmates, I was ready to take on part 3. 

### Part 3 Final Project

My advisors gave me very useful feedback. They helped me explore how to use flourish to make a categorical heatmap, and identified parts of my presentation that could be cut and made more concise. This became very helpful when I found I was able to save time and make a better presentation by cutting out the Prologue. They also helped me identify where elements were becomming overly repetitive and identified some of the most important information. For them, the two facts regarding the relationship between fundraising and ticket prices was essential. 

With their advice, I went ahead and cleaned up the final site. There's still room for improvement, I would have liked to try to incorporate the dashboard feature in tableau, but all in all this was a great success. I felt I learned new software, web-building tools, data visualization tools, and just improved overall as a storyteller with data. Mission Accomplished!
