### Talkin Process

The intention of our user research was to accomplish two goals. 1. Establish clarity of the presentation at hand. 2. Identify missing arguments or strategic oversights. We interviewed three experts including: 1. A CMU International Film Festival Staff Member (Not on Development Team) 2. A Veteran Film Festival Production Manager 3. An Avid Film Fan with Experience Donating to Nonprofit Film Festivals. 

We further interviewed three classmates who provided valuable critique, leaning on their knowledge gained through the Telling Stories with Data class framework. We present to you their insights. 

### Part 1: The Questionnaire

The following matrix presents the questionnaire alongside the intention of each question. 

| Question        | Intention           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 1. Can you explain to me the overall goal of the story?| Define Clarity: Does this story stand on its own? |
| 2. Who do you think is the target audience?| Define Clarity and Audience: Can an audience quickly be identified? If yes, then information presented must be valuable.                    |
| 3. How is data used in this story? Can you share some examples?| Can the audience quickly parse out the informative data and provide a justification for it? If the reader can, then it is clear that the data presented merits consideration|
| 4. What data visualizations did you find helpful? | Identify which visualizations are effective|
| 5. Which data visualizations did you find unclear or not really helpful?| Identify areas for improvement in the visualization | 
| 6. What suggestions do you have for improving the story? | Solicit global feedback for improvement. Identify overlooked material beyond the data viz questions |


### Part 2: Our User Research

| Question        | Avid Fan + Donor | Film Festival Production Manager | CMU International Film Festival Staff Member|
| ------------- |:-------------:| ----|---|
|1. Can you explain to me the overall goal of the story?| The overall goal is to increase funding of the IFF by about 25,000. |I believe the goal is to outline how fundraising strategies can be changed or improved in order to make the new budgetary goal. It took a while before that became apparent, so it might make sense to bring that up as soon as possible so that the audience is primed for the ideas you are presenting them as soon as possible|Strategies for getting sponsorship for IFF this year|
| 2. Who do you think is the target audience?|        Target audience seems to be the marketing people for the festival.            |To me it seems very apparent that this is an internally facing document for the CMU International Film Festival. It is specifically for those involved with development and fundraising.|IFF members. Development team|
| 3. How is data used in this story? Can you share some examples?| The data is used to show areas where you can increase revenue, for example, getting "in kind" donators to switch to monetary donations.  Another is to get restricted donors to lift restrictions allowing for you to pursue other funding streams who may be more inclined to restrict donations.|There is a lot of data represented both visually, with charts and those meters, as well as within the text. I was impressed by the figure that for every $1250 raised, ticket prices go down by a dollar. Maybe that could be represented visually? Or maybe that sentence could be presented on its own to create emphasis?| Data is used to support your points in the story. For example, you make a graph showing the percentage of our budget funded through sponsorship, and you also use graphs of meters to show past sponsorship level and our goal this year which is engaging and clear.|
| 4. What data visualizations did you find helpful? | I like the meter heading toward your goal.  Also standard graphs are useful to see the data.|The tree map was a good way to visualize where the funding comes from. The sub sections were also really great to look at and play around with. I also like the meter, but each one looked a little different, so that was a bit confusing.|I really like the tree map you used to indicate the sources of the funding. I think it is very clear and helpful|
| 5. Which data visualizations did you find unclear or not really helpful?| I did not find the square chart showing funders very compelling.  Maybe do it in pie shape. |The unrestricted funds chart was a little too small to read or understand. Is there another way to show that information that is more clear? Maybe bigger, with a title for the graph?| I think the line chart you used to indicate that our sponsors donate a consistent amount over the years could be made clearer (maybe with more descriptions). Question: does the letters on the graph of the purpose of the funds initials of donors? it is not made very clear here.| 
| 6. What suggestions do you have for improving the story? | I think you should approaching some of your loyal donors to increase their donation by creating a matching competition.  They would agree to fund at current level but present it as a matching challenge.  Not sure how that works. |I am not sure you need to have the section about COVID. There is a lot of time and visuals dedicated to that section before we get to the main point, which seemed to me to be fundraising. Unless there are portions of that section that will directly relate to the upcoming fundraising strategy, I would consider skipping it.| For some graphs it would be helpful to have more descriptions so that it is clearer for the audience.|

### Part 3 Classmate Feedback

Classmate A: There are lots of meters. Perhaps consider locations where you can remove extraneous meters. Zoom in on your graphs as they can be hard to read at this size. 

Classmate B: The Ticket Price Bar Chart was helpful. Consider how you can use a Tableau Dashboard to consolidate your vizualizations and present the material more concisely.  To make the line graph more unified, get rid of the extraneous data. 

Classmate C: Make sure you make it clear that Anonymized Data is Anonymized by indicating in title. If there is a new section that begins with text, give it a headline to anchor the eye. Keep sentences simple. 1 idea per sentence. 

Lastly, classmates and the teaching assistant helped me identify a few approaches to making the troublesome heatmap using categorical data. 

### Part 4 Moving Forwards

I find it interesting that different users had competing opinions on the tree map. I'll likely stick with it but clarify things by changing up the colors. Secondly, the radar feedback was helpful. I would like to use these as periods to each section. So taking out the extraneous ones at the beginning is in order. The 1250=1$ illustration is essential at the beginning. This can help sponsors understand the importance of their contribution. I will elevate this and perhaps display it both as big bold text and as a graph. 

I would further like to try out the dashboard feature as I transition from using screenshots to embedded tables from Tableau. This is probably the most labor learning intensive so I will save it for last. 

The rest is just cleaning up what's here and making sure the colors make sense. Fun ahead!
