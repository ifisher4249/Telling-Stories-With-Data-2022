Hello this Github Page is online and ready for action! *Visualize this!* 
## About Me
My name is Isaac! I am a second year Masters of Arts Management Student, and cartoonist!. Prior to focusing on the management of arts, I was making comic books and teaching ESL. I lived in Korea for 2 years on a Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship and can speak Korean as well as French and Hebrew with basic proficiency. Now I am slowly learning Spanish. I like to sit and make things, especially cartoon stories, but also have lots of fun playing sports and being active and social. Sometimes it's hard to draw these lines. 
## What I hope to learn
I love to draw, write, come up with characters and tell stories, so this class will be a fun way to learn how to incorporate data into these loves. I hope to 1. gain a better theoretical understanding of how to make more interesting, playful, and yet informative designs that harmonize my creativity with a little bit more academic rigor. I also look forward to becoming better equipped with new software skills. Once I graduate, I hope to be a bit of a creative mercenary, lending my cartooning skils, visualization skills, teaching and storytelling skills to the benefit of my community. The Arts Management Education has put me in a position to do this from a leader's perspective.
